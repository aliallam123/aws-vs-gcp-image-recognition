# AWS vs GCP: Image Recognition Showdown ðŸš€

This project benchmarks **Amazon Rekognition** (pre-trained API) against a **custom TensorFlow CNN deployed on Google Cloud** for image recognition.  
The goal: compare **accuracy, latency, cost, and usability** between managed AI services and custom ML workflows.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Compare **AWS Rekognition** (out-of-the-box API) vs **Google Cloud TensorFlow** (trained model).  
- Evaluate across:
  - Accuracy & F1 Score  
  - Latency (inference time per image)  
  - Cost (per 1k images)  
  - Ease of use & scalability  
- Explore **MLOps practices** with Docker for reproducibility.
